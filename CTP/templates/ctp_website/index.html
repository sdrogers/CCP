<p>We’re delighted to have been awarded the EFFE Label by the European Festivals Association!  This new accreditation adds us to the list of Europe’s finest festivals and was awarded following a meeting of the EFA’s panel in May.  We are looking forward to building connections with festivals and venues across Europe!  Read the press release <a href="http://danielsbeard.org.uk/2015_CCP_website/PressRelease_EFFELabel_20052015.pdf">here</a>.</p>

<p><b>Composition Competition:</b> Congratulations to Claire McCue, whose string quartet, Beauty and the Beastie won this year’s competition.  The RSNO ensemble will première it on the opening night.</p>

<p>Tickets for the 2015 festival are now on sale either online or by phone.  We will be opening a box office in the Hillhead Subway branch of Tinderbox from the 2nd May onwards, so if you would like to buy your tickets in person, stop in for a coffee!</p>

<p>If you have either a Subway card or a myWaitrose card then you will be able to get £1 off your booking - don’t forget to ask.</p>

<p>There are also plenty of opportunities to volunteer with us.  We are on the lookout for stewards, first-aiders, hosts for visiting artists, bloggers, home bakers, brochure or flyer deliverers and people to host rehearsals!</p>
