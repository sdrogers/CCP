<h3>Cottier Dance Project</h3>

<p>Glasgow’s only professional dance festival, The Cottier Dance Project is the new, curated dance strand of the West End Festival. In partnership with the hugely successful Cottier Chamber Project, the Cottier Dance Project aims to champion Scottish-based choreographers and dancers, to provide a platform for new work and to forge new collaborations across the arts to create and develop original performance pieces.  As well as contemporary, commissioned work, there will also be a focus on archival dance footage and arts film, so that great and inspirational work from the past can be revisited.</p>

<p>We are delighted to be using Cottier’s Theatre and the Grosvenor Cinema as our host venues, with the programme including five, live performances and two screenings of dance related film.</p>

<p>The live performances at Cottier’s Theatre include:</p>

<p><b>Footprints: 23rd, 24th, 25th at 6.30pm</b></p>

<p>This exciting new work is a collaboration between multi-award winning Scots' singer Emily Smith, musician Jamie McClennan and the dancers of High Heart Dance Company. Using new and existing music by Emily and Jamie, the artists link traditional music and contemporary movement to explore and celebrate the songs, music and rhythms that have journeyed into today’s culture.</p>

<p><b>Watch This Space: 25th, 26th at 8.30pm</b></p>

<p>A platform for new choreography, Watch This Space presents new, short works by independent choreographers and dancers from Scotland's national companies. A great chance to enjoy different styles of work in one programme... A taster menu!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Cottier Dance Project will be involved with The Cottier Chamber Project’s family concert at St Silas Church at 11am on Saturday 14 June. Two dancers join host ensemble Daniel’s Beard in the premiere of a specially commissioned piece; a setting of Tennyson’s ‘The Lady of Shalott’, by composer Lenny Sayers, with narration by singer and BBC presenter Jamie MacDougall.</p>

<p>From traditional music and contemporary dance collaboration, new choreographic showcases and open dance classes, to ballet archive footage and the ‘Golden Age’ of musical film, The Cottier Dance Project presents a brilliantly diverse programme in its first year.</p>
