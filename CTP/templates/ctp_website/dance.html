<h3>Cottier Dance Project</h3>

<p>Glasgow’s only dance festival, The Cottier Dance Project will add a professional dance thread to the West End Festival running along the Cottier Chamber Project, offering audiences the chance to see professional performances of varied dance genres, original collaborative work across the arts, dance related film and discussion sessions. </p>

<p>The Dance Project will run from 23rd June - 27th June, with 3 performances of ‘Footprints’, a collaboration between traditional musicians Emily Smith and Jamie McClennan and four contemporary dancers at Cottier’s Theatre.  This collaboration will explore the individual and corporate identities of the performers, their respective disciplines, and the sum of their partnerships.  The dancers will be creating choreography that enhances the sentiments expressed in the existing traditional Scots songs by Emily Smith and specially commissioned new music by Jamie McClennan.  There will also be two showcase performances of new choreographic works by independent artists and dancers from Scotland's national companies.  Alongside these live performances, there will be a screening of archive ballet footage with an introductory talk from a ballet specialist, and showings of the Fred Astaire and Ginger Rodgers film ‘Shall We Dance’ with a talk from a respected arts critic.  These will take place at the Grosvenor Cinema, a popular venue for mainstream and art films, ensuring a varied programme for the first year of the Project.</p>

<p>The Cottier Dance Project is curated by Freya Jeffs, with support from the Cottier Chamber Project team.</p>
