<h3>Cottier Dance Project</h3>

<p>The Cottier Dance Project is the dance programme of the Chamber Project. After a successful pilot year in 2014, The Dance Project expanded its programme for 2015, and will continue to champion Scottish-based choreographers and dancers, to provide a platform for new work and to forge new collaborations across the arts to create and develop original performance pieces. This year, as well as contemporary, commissioned work, there will also be a focus on archival dance footage and arts film, so that great and inspirational work from the past can be revisited. We are delighted to be using Cottier’s Theatre, The Tramway Theatre and the Grosvenor Cinema as our host venues, with the programme including live performances of contemporary, music and dance collaborations and screenings of archive and independent dance film. This also includes special performances from ROSAS Dance Company and a UK première screening of a dance film by Peter Darrell from 1965, never seen before in the UK.</p>

<p>The Cottier Dance Project is curated by Freya Jeffs, with support from the Cottier Chamber Project team.</p>
