<h3>Cottier Dance Project</h3>

<p>Glasgow’s only professional dance festival, The Cottier Dance Project is the new, curated dance strand of the West End Festival. In partnership with the hugely successful Cottier Chamber Project, the Cottier Dance Project aims to champion Scottish-based choreographers and dancers, to provide a platform for new work and to forge new collaborations across the arts to create and develop original performance pieces. As well as contemporary, commissioned work, there will also be a focus on archival dance footage and arts film, so that great and inspirational work from the past can be revisited.</p>

<p>We are delighted to be using Cottier’s Theatre and the Grosvenor Cinema as our host venues, with the programme including five, live performances, two screenings of dance related film, and two dance classes.</p>

<p>On the 22nd June at 3pm, we are privileged to be screening the archive footage of Kenneth MacMillan’s ‘Elite Syncopations’, originally broadcast on the BBC in 1975.  The original Royal Ballet cast includes Dame Monica Mason, Dame Merle Park and David Wall amongst others.  There will also be an introductory talk from a highly respected member of the ballet community.  For appreciators of ballet and dance history, this is a special occasion and should not be missed!  Many thanks to the BFI and the Grosvenor Cinema, who will also be showing the classic Hollywood musical 'Shall We Dance' (1937), starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.</p>


<p>The live performances at Cottier’s Theatre include:</p>
