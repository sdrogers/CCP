<h3>Tickets</h3>
<h4>For advance bookings:</h4>
<div style="margin-left:20px"><p><b>Online</b></p>
<p>If you would like to buy tickets for multiple performances, you can do this below, otherwise there is an individual link on each concert page.  Tickets can be collected from the box office, printed off at home, posted (£1.50 extra) or sent directly to a mobile phone (50p extra).  </p>

<p><b>Telephone bookings:</b></p>
<p>Available on  0333 666 3366 Monday – Friday 9am – 7pm, Saturday 9am – 5pm.  Telephone bookings incur an extra charge of £1.50.</p>

<p><b>Box office:</b></p>
<p>Box office:  There will be a box office situated at Tinderbox in Hillhead Subway during May and June, open Monday – Saturday, 11am-6pm. The box office will be open from Saturday 2nd May until the end of the festival - even if you have already bought your tickets, pop in for a chat (and a coffee!).</p>

<p><b>Loyalty card:</b></p>
<p>
Pick up a loyalty card and get it stamped on your way into the venue - your 6th concert will be free. You won’t need to buy a ticket for the free concert, though it is subject to availability, so if you think a concert may sell out, don’t wait! Some of our events have unusual or unfamiliar programmes, so it might be worth taking a risk on one of those as your freebie.

<h4>Loyalty Card</h4>
<div style="margin-left:20px"><p>Inspired by coffee houses the world over, we are introducing a loyalty card for our evening series this year.  Get it stamped on your way into the venue, and your 6th concert will be free.  You won’t need to buy a ticket for the free concert, though it is subject to availability, so if you think a concert may sell out, don’t wait!
