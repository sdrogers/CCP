<h3>About Us</h3>
<p>The Cottier Chamber Project is part of Glasgow's West End Festival. 
Running since 2011, the series aims to:</p>
<ul>
	<li>bring top quality professional chamber music to Glasgow's West End</li>
	<li>showcase the variety and depth of talent in Scotland</li>
	<li>promote and introduce chamber music to new and existing audiences</li>
	<li>entertain, challenge, inspire and satisfy audiences and performers</li>
 	<li>have a great time listening to and playing great music!</li>
</ul>
<p>In partnership with Four Acres Charitable Trust, Cottier’s hosts the main evening series, which is made up of concerts that last for around an hour.  As the programme is packed with a huge variety of ensembles and composers, this means that you can put together your own programme to suit your tastes, try something completely new (and if you don’t like it, it’s only an hour of your life that you won’t get back!), take in two completely contrasting performances in one evening with a meal in between, or simply take pot luck and see what happens.  </p>

<p>With descriptions ranging from 'the music of friends' to 'four men in a room, conversing rationally', it's easy to see why chamber music is so powerful! It’s where ideas are thrown around, examined, rejected and approved...where emotions of every type are worn on the sleeve...where musicians can speak for themselves, communicating with their colleagues and with the audience.</p>

<p>We are keen to hear what you think about programme, scheduling, presentation and anything else that strikes you, so please feel free to stop any of the team and let us know your thoughts.  The team that runs the series is:</p>
