Brass Jaw	jazz	Working without a traditional rhythm section, Brass Jaw creates a performance that is truly unique in sound and direction, revealing a group that is able to adapt to almost any performance environment. Brass Jaw’s concerts are characterised by the band’s trademark momentum, drive  and charisma, in a set that strongly embraces the jazz tradition whilst reaching out into the unknown towards new musical territory. Deep at the heart of Brass Jaw’s philosophy is the idea that music should be as engaging, entertaining and humorous as it is virtuosic, cerebral and progressive. Brass Jaw makes a deliberate and committed statement. The ensemble’s flexibility makes it the ideal vehicle for new compositions from members of the group as well as commissions for renowned composers such as ECM recording artist John Surman who composed two new works for Brass Jaw, premiered at the 2009 British Composers Awards.	http://www.brassjaw.co.uk/images/stories/BrassjawImages/brassjaw_by_calum_morrel01.jpg	someone credit	http://www.brassjaw.co.uk/images/stories/BrassjawImages/brassjaw_by_calum_morrell11.jpg	Calum Morrell

Miles Davis	jazz	Long held as the jazz album that even non-jazz fans will own, Kind Of Blue not only changed the way people regarded Miles, it changed the very face of music itself. Consistently rated not just as one of the greatest jazz albums but as one of THE greatest musical statements of the 20th century, its 46 minutes of improvisation and sophistication remain peerless. In the early 50s George Russell had raised the possibility of using a modal approach (i.e. playing within a certain scale, as opposed to according to a fixed chord sequence) as a way out of the straightjacket that restricted improvisation. Miles, at this time, was in thrall to hard bop, but by 1958's Milestones he was ready to try the modal approach, the title track being his first recorded foray into the form. Kind Of Blue, released the following year, took the idea and developed it to an astounding degree. Its smoky evocation of late night ambience is a byword for laid back elegance. It uses the blues but transmutes those seventh chords into something that still sounds modern 50 years on. Quite simply, the sonic space it creates sounds like the coolest place on the planet.	http://dc4cor.files.wordpress.com/2011/12/the-sound-of-miles-davis.jpg	a credit	http://assets-s3.rollingstone.com/assets/images/artists/304x304/miles-davis.jpg	another credit
